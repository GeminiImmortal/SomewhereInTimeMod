Save an ancient realm lost in time which has fallen under the iron grip of the evil illager empire!

 

Somewhere in Time is a narrative-driven experience featuring a dynamic, ever-evolving world and extensive lore to uncover. It provides a significant step-up in challenge compared to base Minecraft, with enemy types possessing more complex behavior and diverse attack patterns than nearly any vanilla mob. Somewhere in Time adds a plethora of extensive and exciting new features.

Some highlights include:

 -   Six new and varied biomes, consisting almost entirely of brand new modded blocks.
 -   A magic system that gives the player interesting and powerful new abilities.
 -   A full, custom soundtrack, with songs ranging from soothing ambience to intense boss battle music.
 -   A reputation system, referred to as "Infamy", which tracks the player's standing with the empire, dynamically updating to reflect how big of a threat they view the player as and how the Empire responds to the player's actions.
  -  A capture point system in which players can clear Imperial-controlled structures and claim them for the Rebels.
  -  A guidebook (made possible by Patchouli) that keeps track of information about Mobius, such as biome descriptions, lore entries, and Infamy rank.
   

And many more!

GeckoLib 3 and Patchouli are required dependencies for this mod!

 

Somewhere in Time is a passion project made by only two developers, but that has not limited our ambition for it in the slightest. We aim to create an entirely new experience that has never been seen before in a Minecraft mod.
